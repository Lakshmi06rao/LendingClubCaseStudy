## General Information
A consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.​

Two types of risks that are associated with the bank’s decision are:​

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company​

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company​

The lending case study leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in past loan applications. By examining consumer and loan attributes, we aim to develop insights that will guide decisions on loan approvals, optimizing our risk management strategy while maximizing business potential.​

## Conclusions
Individuals with lower incomes are more likely to have their loans charged off, as indicated by the lower median income in the "Charged Off" category.​

The distribution of income among those who are current on their loans or have fully paid them off is somewhat similar, though the median is slightly higher for those who are current, potentially indicating better financial stability.​

The income may have some correlation with loan outcomes, with those having higher incomes being slightly more likely to keep their loans current or fully paid off.​

The fact that charged-off loans have a slightly higher average funded amount than fully paid loans might imply that higher amounts may correlate with a higher risk of default, although the difference is not large.​

Overall suggestion, is that larger loans are more likely to still be active (current), while smaller loans are more likely to be fully paid off. 
The risk of loans being charged off appears to be slightly higher for loans with a moderate amount of funding.
